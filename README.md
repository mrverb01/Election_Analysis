# Election_Analysis HW Module 3
## Overview of ELection Audit
The purpose of the assignment was to analyze voting data for an election commision. Through the homework we had to showcase the ability of create repetition statements, conditional statements with logical operators, and print statements. Addtionally, we had to print out the candidate and county election results to the command line.

## Election Audit Results
369,711 total votes were casted in the congressional election. Broken out by county, Denver (82.8%, 306K) obtained the majory of votes followed by Jefferson (10.5%, 39K) and then Arapahoe (6.7%, 25K). Among the candidates, Diane DeGette (73.8%, 273K) was the clear winner followed by a distant Charles Casper Stockham (23.0%, 85K) and lastly Raymon Anthony Doane (3.1%, 12K).

## Election Audit Summary
The current dataset could be modified to give a vote count and percentage of votes for each candidate in each county. In this way the election commision will know if Diane Degette won across all counties. Another modification could be highlighting quality assurance. Since the data set offers Ballot ID a code could be writte to ensure unique ballot ids are only counted once.
